            <h2 class="title is-4">About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hey there! I’m a passionate programmer who loves collaborating with teams and turning ideas into real,
                functional software. I enjoy helping clients find creative, practical solutions—whether it's for the
                web, games, or custom software. I'm always curious and open to learning new tools or approaches to push
                projects forward.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Background & Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I started out with an internship as a technician in a hospital, and for the past two years, I’ve been
                working—first as an intern, now as a full team member—at a web development research institute. That
                experience has given me a strong foundation not just in coding, but in identifying needs, proposing
                improvements, and building smart, helpful features. I like going the extra mile when time allows and
                make it a point to be proactive and self-driven in solving problems.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Highlight</h3>
            <p>
                I worked with Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot for a school project. The experience was very eye-opening—I
                initially thought it would be simple, but it turned out to be much more complex. We faced development
                challenges, and also lost time due to a teachers’ strike during that period. In the end, we built a
                program that allowed the robot to pick up an orange cone and move it, along with a partially working
                sensor setup integrated with Grafana.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Skills & Specialties</h3>
            <p>
                I thrive in collaborative environments and adapt quickly to new challenges. My strongest areas are web
                development (especially with PHP, HTMX, jQuery, and Latte), along with solid experience in C#, C++,
                Java, Python, and Unity game dev. Beyond technical skills, I bring clear communication, initiative, and
                a team-first mindset.
