            <p>
                Hey there! I’m a passionate programmer who loves collaborating with teams and turning ideas into real,
                functional software. I enjoy helping clients find creative, practical solutions—whether it's for the
                web, games, or custom software. I'm always curious and open to learning new tools or approaches to push
                projects forward.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Background & Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I started out with an internship as a technician in a hospital, and for the past two years, I’ve been
                working—first as an intern, now as a full team member—at a web development research institute. That
                experience has given me a strong foundation not just in coding, but in identifying needs, proposing
                improvements, and building smart, helpful features. I like going the extra mile when time allows and
                make it a point to be proactive and self-driven in solving problems.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Highlight</h3>
            <p>
                I worked with Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot for a school project. The experience was very eye-opening—I
                initially thought it would be simple, but it turned out to be much more complex. We faced development
                challenges, and also lost time due to a teachers’ strike during that period. In the end, we built a
                program that allowed the robot to pick up an orange cone and move it, along with a partially working
                sensor setup integrated with Grafana.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Skills & Specialties</h3>
            <p>
                I thrive in collaborative environments and adapt quickly to new challenges. My strongest areas are web
                development (especially with PHP, HTMX, jQuery, and Latte), along with solid experience in C#, C++,
                Java, Python, and Unity game dev. Beyond technical skills, I bring clear communication, initiative, and
                a team-first mindset.

                    I’ve worked with Spot robot in the fall semester of my college degree’s last year. We
                    learned
                    a
                    lot during this project which only lasted about 6 weeks. We we able to experiment some new
                    environment like docker to be able to push our programs to the dog. We also had to
                    experiment
                    data collection with a sensor and Grafana to display them. After the couple of weeks we had,
                    here’s the final result :

                <p>
                    As you can see in the video, we don’t have any data collection. This for two main reasons :
                    the task was way bigger than what we expected, so our goals where over what we could
                    achieve; also, we suffered from teacher’s strikes which cost us some testing time that was
                    very important as we were discovering the platform.

                    In my last college semester, I did a project to have a website showing the precipitation of the day
                    or week with different charts and options. We did this work using Arduino to collect the data, MQTT
                    to transfer them and PHP and MySQL to get the data from the MQTT broker. Finally I could display
                    them with the help of the Chart,js library.
